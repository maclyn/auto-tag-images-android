auto-tag-images-android
=======================
HackNY Fall 2014 Entry

Tag images automatically on Android phones using Clarifai's preview API (you'll need to be invited to build/run -- the keys in the project don't work). Very rough camera support for setting scene mode by elements within the screen. 

Project mostly coded from scratch by Maclyn, Rushil, and Tim with a bit of sample code for handling camera making it into the current release. Uses RetroFit for REST calls and Picasso for lighter image loading.
