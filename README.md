auto-tag-images-android
=======================
HackNY Fall 2014 Entry

Tag images automatically on Android phones using Clarifai's preview API (you'll need to be invited to build/run -- the keys in the project don't work). Very rough camera support for setting scene mode by elements within the screen.
